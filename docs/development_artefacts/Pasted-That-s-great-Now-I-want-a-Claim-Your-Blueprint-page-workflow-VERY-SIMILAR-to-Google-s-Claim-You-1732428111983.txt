That's great! Now I want a 'Claim Your Blueprint' page / workflow VERY SIMILAR to Google's Claim Your Business flow. This can happen when this happens: 1. **Detect User Entry into a New Location**: - **Mechanism**: Use the user's GPS location combined with geofencing. If the user enters a location for which a Blueprint doesn’t yet exist, trigger the **Blueprint Agent-Onboarding Retrieval (BAR) Method**. - **Automation**: - Match the location against online sources (Google Maps, Yelp, TripAdvisor, Foursquare, etc.) to retrieve the location name, address, and primary URL. - Use the URL as the primary source for all subsequent data gathering. 2. **Run the BAR Method in Real-Time**: - Automatically collect: - **General Information**: Name, address, hours, contact info, social media. - **Menu/Product Catalog/Exhibit Information**: Based on the type of location, scrape and categorize data. - **Facility Layout and Mapping**: If available, gather layout or map data. - **Experience Enhancements**: Look for mentions of loyalty programs, events, or other unique features. - Store the collected data in Firebase. 3. **Create a "Base-Level" Blueprint**: - Define a base-level Blueprint as one that: - Includes core features (e.g., menu for restaurants, product locator for retail). - Relies only on publicly available information gathered during the BAR Method. - Defaults to popular/common configurations for user features (e.g., “Menu” and “Order” enabled for restaurants). - Example: A restaurant's base Blueprint would show: - Address, contact info, and hours. - Menu items with no loyalty program or custom branding unless explicitly available online. 4. **Notify the Location Manager**: - **Mechanism**: If the business has contact info (email or phone) available, notify the manager that a Blueprint has been automatically created for their location. - **Message**: "We’ve created a free, basic Blueprint for your business. Customize it with your branding, loyalty programs, and special features to enhance customer interactions." - This provides a potential onboarding pathway for location managers who want to improve their Blueprint. 5. **Activate the Blueprint for Users**: - Once the base-level Blueprint is created, users can immediately interact with it: - View menus, product catalogs, or exhibits. - Access location maps (if available). - Use Quick-Toggle Toolbar features based on the default configuration. - If any data is missing (e.g., specials, loyalty programs), it can be flagged for enhancement when the manager engages. --- ### **What Data Can Be Fully Automated?** With the right agent setup, the following data can almost always be sourced online: 1. **General Information**: - Location name, address, hours, contact info, social media links. - Most businesses list this data on their website, Google Business profile, or platforms like Yelp and TripAdvisor. 2. **Menus or Product Catalogs**: - Many restaurants and retail stores have menus or product listings on their website, third-party apps (Uber Eats, Shopify stores), or review sites. - Even for smaller businesses, it’s often possible to extract item names, descriptions, and prices. 3. **(sometimes) Promotions or Specials**: - Seasonal offers or promotions can often be scraped from a location’s social media or event pages. --- ### **What Data Must Come from the Manager?** There are certain pieces of information that *may* not be available publicly, depending on the location. Without the manager’s input, the following might be incomplete: 1. **Loyalty Programs**: - Details like how points are earned/redeemed, tiers, or member benefits are often not public unless the location explicitly advertises them. 2. **Store / Facility Layout** 3. **Customization Settings**: - How the location wants their Blueprint configured (e.g., which features to enable/disable). - Brand-specific AR elements (e.g., logo placements, unique visualizations). 4. **Unique Features or Experiences**: - Some locations have highly specific offerings that aren’t detailed online, such as private dining options, unique event spaces, or special services. 5. **Real-Time Updates**: - Dynamic data like "today’s specials," real-time stock levels, or temporary closures typically require either a direct feed from the location’s internal systems or manual input. 6. **Branding and Personalization**: - Managers may want their Blueprint to reflect their unique branding, such as custom icons, color schemes, or additional narratives about their business. --- ### **Potential Issues Without Manager Input** While creating base Blueprints automatically can help scale quickly, there are some trade-offs: 1. **Limited Personalization**: - Without manager input, Blueprints may lack branded elements or tailored experiences that make them stand out. 2. **Incomplete or Outdated Data**: - Even with agent capabilities, some data (like hours of operation or menu updates) may be outdated unless explicitly managed. 3. **Missed Opportunities for Engagement**: - Features like loyalty programs, AR-enhanced experiences, or interactive storytelling are harder to implement without manager involvement. --- ### **How Does This Enable Exponential Scaling?** 1. **Minimal Input Needed**: - By relying on publicly available data and agent capabilities, you eliminate the need for most manual onboarding steps. 2. **User-Driven Expansion**: - Every time a user enters a new location, the system can automatically create a base Blueprint for that location, adding it to the Blueprint network. 3. **Gradual Customization**: - Locations that see value in their Blueprint can engage later to customize and enhance their experience. This reduces the barrier to entry for adoption. for reference to the other method: ### **Overview** The **Blueprint Agent-Onboarding Retrieval (BAR) Method** is a step-by-step, high-level guide to using an AI agent to automatically gather and populate all relevant data needed to onboard a location in the Blueprint system. This method starts with minimal input (location name, address, and URL) and leverages the agent's capabilities to retrieve, categorize, and organize additional required information. This document is designed for both technical and non-technical team members, outlining each step to ensure a streamlined, efficient, and accurate onboarding process. --- ### **Inputs Required** 1. **Location Name**: The official name of the location (e.g., “Roots & Vines Restaurant”). OR 1. **Location Address**: The full physical address for validation and geographical reference. OR 1. **Location URL**: The main website URL of the location to serve as the primary data source. --- ### **Step-by-Step Method** --- ### **Step 1: Retrieve General Information** - **Objective**: Use the agent to gather and validate essential contact details from the location’s website and/or online presence. - **Process**: - **Agent Action**: Visit the URL and locate general information, such as the address, phone number, email, and social media links. - **Data Points to Collect**: - **Address** - **Hours of Operation** - **Contact Information** (Phone, Email, Social Media Links) - **Validation**: Cross-reference gathered information with address and contact details provided to confirm accuracy. --- ### **Step 2: Gather Menu or Product Catalog Information** **Note**: Steps vary by location type. Adapt based on whether the location is a restaurant, retail store, grocery store, museum, or hotel. --- **If Location Type is a Restaurant / Food Setting:** - **Objective**: Collect comprehensive menu details for each category. - **Process**: - **Agent Action**: Navigate to the “Menu” section of the website, identify categories (e.g., Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts), and extract items. - **Data Points to Collect**: - **Menu Categories**: Appetizers, Main Courses, Desserts, etc. - **Individual Items**: - Name, Description, Price - Ingredients, Allergen Information, Dietary Tags (e.g., gluten-free, vegan) - **Specials and Promotions**: Any highlighted or seasonal items. - **Additional Enhancement**: If available, capture wine/drink pairings and event information (e.g., wine tastings, live music nights) under a section called **Experience Enhancements**. **If Location Type is a Retail Store or Grocery Store:** - **Objective**: Populate the product catalog with detailed descriptions, pricing, and availability. - **Process**: - **Agent Action**: Locate the “Products” or “Catalog” section, identify major categories, and gather details. - **Data Points to Collect**: - **Product Categories**: Apparel, Electronics, Produce, Dairy, etc. - **Individual Product Details**: - Name, Description, Price - SKU, Available Colors/Sizes, Stock Information - **Discounts and Promotions**: Any store-wide or seasonal discounts listed. - **Optional Layout Info**: Collect aisle or section mapping information if available, including any popular or featured zones. **If Location Type is a Museum / Art Gallery:** - **Objective**: Gather details for individual exhibits and relevant events. - **Process**: - **Agent Action**: Visit the “Exhibits” or “Collections” page, extract exhibit details, and gather event information. - **Data Points to Collect**: - **Exhibit Sections**: Ancient Art, Modern Art, etc. - **Individual Exhibit Details**: - Name, Description, Artist/Creator, Year Created - Audio Guide or Virtual Tour Links (if available) - **Event Information**: Scheduled talks, tours, or special events. - **Museum Layout Info**: Collect map information to highlight key exhibits and gift shop items. **If Location Type is a Hotel / Hospitality:** - **Objective**: Compile room types, amenities, and on-site service information. - **Process**: - **Agent Action**: Extract information from “Rooms,” “Amenities,” or “Facilities” sections of the website. - **Data Points to Collect**: - **Room Types and Descriptions**: King suite, ocean view, standard room, etc. - **Room Amenities**: Features like bed type, view, balcony. - **On-Site Amenities**: Pool, gym, spa, restaurants, meeting rooms. - **Service Options**: Room service menu, housekeeping, check-in/check-out assistance. - **Event Spaces**: Details on meeting rooms, banquet halls. --- ### **Step 3: Capture Facility Layout and Mapping Information** **If Applicable**: - **Objective**: Obtain a layout or map of the facility to enhance location-specific guidance within the Blueprint experience. - **Process**: - **Agent Action**: Search for a facility map or layout on the website, either as a downloadable PDF or embedded image. - **Data Points to Collect**: - **Seating Zones**: For restaurants (e.g., lounge, bar, main dining). - **Aisle Mapping**: For retail/grocery stores (popular zones or featured product areas). - **Interactive Map**: For museums, highlighting key exhibits. - **Special Notes**: If no layout is available, the agent will flag this for manual follow-up or possible generation from available data. --- ### **Step 4: Capture Additional Experience Enhancements** - **Objective**: Gather data that will further personalize the user experience and engage users. - **Process**: - **Agent Action**: Identify sections on the website that describe additional services or enhancements, such as loyalty programs or event promotions. - **Data Points to Collect**: - **Loyalty Program Information**: Benefits for return customers, points accrual, or special offers. - **Promotional Events**: Special events like live music or seasonal menus (if applicable). - **Concierge Recommendations**: For hotels, collect recommended local attractions or partner restaurants. --- ### **Step 5: Auto-Fill and Organize Data in Blueprint Onboarding Template** - **Objective**: Organize the collected data into Blueprint’s onboarding template. - **Process**: - **Agent Action**: Populate the relevant fields in Blueprint’s data structure for each location type. - **Structure**: - **General Info**: Filled with address, hours, contact information. - **Core Sections**: Menu, Product Catalog, Exhibit Info, Room Info, etc., based on location type. - **Enhancements and Layout**: Loyalty program, maps, seating/aisle layout. - **Final Review**: Validate auto-filled data for accuracy and completeness, flagging any fields that may need human verification. --- ### **Output Summary** After completing these steps, the agent will generate a structured, location-specific Blueprint profile with all essential data pre-populated. This profile will be ready for final review and any manual adjustments if needed. **Question:** Once the Blueprint for a location has been created - what exactly do we store in Firebase? What do we just load in the beginning of the user sessions? --- ### **Agent Fallback Process** If the agent encounters incomplete data on the primary URL, it will: 1. Attempt to gather data from secondary sources (such as social media links, Google business profiles, or Yelp listings). 2. Flag missing information for manual follow-up if secondary sources also lack data. Basically when a user walks into a location that does not have a Blueprint, we'll create a 'basic Blueprint' based on the location's template - BUT we still want the Manager/Location to claim the Blueprint to further customize it, etc. Can you create this view/workflow for me?
