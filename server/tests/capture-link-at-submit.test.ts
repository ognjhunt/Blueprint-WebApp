/**
 * The link a site gets at submit, and what it is allowed to do.
 *
 * ## What changed
 *
 * A capture token used to be minted only after a request had cleared the screen
 * and been dispatched, and it went out by email. So holding a valid token was
 * the same thing as being allowed to use it, and a site that already knew it
 * had passed still had to go and find an inbox for a link that existed a second
 * after it pressed submit.
 *
 * The link is now issued at submit to every site, whatever the screen said. That
 * breaks the old equivalence, and these tests are about the thing that replaces
 * it: the token names a storage destination, and permission is re-read from the
 * request every time the link is used.
 *
 * The security half matters more than the convenience half. If a token issued
 * to a blocked site could be POSTed to, the whole screen would be advisory —
 * so the refusal is tested on the server, not on the page.
