# Blueprint — long-form overview

## Product overview
Blueprint is a robotics data platform for creating, delivering, and validating simulation-ready assets. It provides SimReady 3D environments, datasets, and evaluation tooling so robotics teams can train, benchmark, and deploy AI systems with confidence. Blueprint also offers on-site capture and custom scene production to transform real locations into reusable digital twins for simulation.

## Positioning
- **Robotics simulation data platform:** access a curated marketplace of scenes and datasets, run evaluations, and integrate assets into simulator workflows.
- **Sim-to-real readiness:** assets are built for physics accuracy, semantic labeling, and task coverage so teams can train and validate policies with confidence.
- **Custom scene production:** Blueprint can capture real locations and deliver tailored SimReady environments for specific tasks.

## Key capabilities
- SimReady environments and datasets with semantic labels and physics-ready materials.
- Marketplace discovery for scenes, training sets, and bundle packs.
- Evaluation and analytics for data quality, policy benchmarking, and sim-to-real transfer.
- On-site capture and custom scene production for robotics teams.
- Integration-focused docs and guides for simulator pipelines.
