          Blueprint helps businesses find a suitable way to automate recurring work. Start with the job:
          we analyze your video, reconstruct the site, compare compatible robots and policies, and help you choose a delivery
          partner for a measured pilot. The beta is free for sites and partners.

          <h2>How it works</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>A site sends video of recurring work. We analyze it and draft a job brief for the site to review.</li>
            <li>We reconstruct the site in simulation, evaluate compatible robots and policies, and check delivery feasibility.</li>
            <li>The customer reviews delivery proposals, chooses a partner and agrees a measured pilot directly with that company.</li>
            <li>We record the outcome so the next decision can build on what was learned.</li>
