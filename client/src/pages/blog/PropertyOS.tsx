                propertyOS – our third phase
              </h1>

              <p>
                Blueprint is building the operating system for physical
                spaces—our motto is{" "}
                <strong>“know the place to serve the person.”</strong>{" "}
                propertyOS brings that vision to real estate. For{" "}
                <em>listings</em>, it delivers immersive, on-site AR staging and
                AI answers that boost buyer confidence. For <em>residents</em>,
                it introduces a persistent home layer that anyone in the
                household can use to personalize their space beyond the limits
                of the physical world.
              </p>

              <h2>Two programs for impact</h2>
              <p>
                propertyOS ships in two coordinated programs: the{" "}
                <strong>Seller Experience Suite</strong> (for listing agents &
                sellers) and the <strong>Resident Experience Suite</strong> (for
                owners & housemates). Both run on the same spatial map of the
                home, so improvements on one side compound benefits on the
                other.
              </p>

              <h3>Seller Experience Suite</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>AR staging overlays:</strong> Instantly furnish vacant
                  or dated rooms with lifelike layouts, finishes, and
                  lighting—toggled live during showings or captured in 3D tours.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Design “switchers”:</strong> One tap to preview styles
                  (modern, cozy, minimalist), flooring/paint swaps, or
                  kitchen/bath variations—without moving a single couch.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Guided tours + hotspots:</strong> Visitors follow
                  subtle AR cues with callouts for upgrades, energy features,
                  storage, and neighborhood notes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>AI Q&amp;A at the property:</strong> Buyers ask
                  natural questions (“HOA rules?”, “2023 utility average?”,
                  “What’s the school zoning?”) and get transparent answers with
                  docs attached.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Remote-ready assets:</strong> One spatial map powers
                  3D tours and interactive floor plans for online shoppers.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Resident Experience Suite</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Persistent home layer:</strong> Shared widgets for
                  groceries, chores, calendars, and “where things live” labels
                  anchored to real surfaces and appliances.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Household access, like Wi-Fi:</strong> Anyone you
                  invite (roommates, family, guests) can “join” your home’s AR
                  layer on any supported device—no need for a specific host to
                  be present.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Collaborative &amp; controlled:</strong> Default is
                  editable by everyone you allow; granular permissions let
                  owners lock certain elements or rooms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cross-platform by design:</strong> Works across
                  headsets, glasses, and phones—so visitors always get the
                  experience you set up.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Living documentation:</strong> Maintenance notes
                  pinned to the water heater, filter reminders on the HVAC,
                  measurements on walls &amp; windows, warranties attached to
                  appliances.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h2>ROI snapshot</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Staging raises perceived value:</strong> In NAR’s
                  staging research, agents report buyers find it easier to
                  visualize living in a staged home, and a share of agents see
                  offers increase by <strong>~1–5%</strong>.{" "}

                    <a href="#src-1">[1]</a>

                  </sup>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Time-on-market reductions:</strong> Sellers’ agents
                  report staging can <em>decrease</em> days on market (from
                  “slight” to “great” reductions depending on the listing).{" "}
                  <sup>
                    <a href="#src-3">[3]</a>
                  </sup>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>3D tours drive attention:</strong> On Zillow, listings
                  with a 3D Home tour see about <strong>43% more views</strong>{" "}
                  and <strong>55% more saves</strong> vs. photo-only.{" "}
                  <sup>

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Faster sales with 3D:</strong> Zillow found homes with
                  a 3D Home tour sold <strong>~14% faster</strong> on average
                  than those without.{" "}

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>More qualified leads:</strong> Matterport reports
                  listings with immersive media can yield{" "}
                  <strong>up to ~49% more leads</strong> vs. traditional media.{" "}

                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Reality check:</strong> Some analysts note ROI varies
                  by market; staging costs can rise, and not every uplift is
                  guaranteed—transparent expectations and quality execution
                  still matter.{" "}
